# Bash Scripting

#### This repository contains my learnings of Bash(shell) Scripting. 

Welcome to my Bash Scripting Learning Journey repository! This is a personal collection of Bash programs and scripts that I've created while learning Bash scripting. Each program represents a different concept or topic that I've explored during my journey into Bash scripting.

## Learning Topics

Throughout this learning journey, I've covered a variety of Bash scripting topics, including:

- Variables and Comments
- Reading User Input
- Conditional Statements (If-Else, Case)
- File and Directory Manipulation
- Looping (WHILE, UNTIL, FOR, SELECT)
- Working with Arrays
- Functions and Scope (Local & Global Variables)
- Script Input and Output
- Error Handling
- and more...

## Scripts Included

1. **Find File in System:** A script to search for a file within the system's directory structure.
2. **Find Files of the Same Type:** This script identifies and lists all files of a given type in the current directory.
3. **Replace File Content:** A script designed to replace specific content in a file.
4. **Docker Installation Script:** Install Docker on an Ubuntu-based system using this script.

To explore the scripts in this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/lokeshdangii/Bash-Shell-Scripting.git`.
2. Navigate to the specific script directory using `cd Bash-Shell-Scripting`.
3. Make the script executable using `chmod +x script-name.sh`.
4. Run the script with `./script-name.sh`.
